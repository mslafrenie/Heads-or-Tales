# Analyzing and Resisting Canadian Myths Through the Royal Canadian Mint’s Millennium Coin Contest, 1999-2000

These RTI models were created for the course HIST 5908, as credit toward the degree of Master of Arts in History – Public History with Specialization in Digital Humanities.

The goal of this project is to challenge dominant narratives of Canadian commemorative coins and to re-situate them in narratives that highlight the nuances of the histories they signify and obscure. The six coins chosen for this project were minted as part of the "Create a Centsation" millennium coin contest. It is time to flip these coins and listen to their tales.
